                    <p>This build, that hasn't been in a good spot during the pre-season, seems to find a better place in the higher tiers after the recent patch that, not only has improved the minion's statistics, but has also increased the Necromancer's damage and survivability; meanwhile the movement and clear speed still are not the best, we can work on them throught the gear and aspects, making this build an excellent and interesting choice for those players who want to try the "necromancer classic experience", leading your minion's army deeper and deeper throught the nightmare. Following you will find the gear, skill and paragon tree that you'll need to make your undead army invincible, ready to destroy Lilith's creatures and her plans!</p>

            <p>Leveling as a Minion isn't that easy as it will be clearing waves of monsters later on once you'll reach higher level. Since the skill tree doesn't provide real effective boost on our minions on the early stages, it is suggested to level up as a <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/bone-spear-necromancer-guide">Bone Spear Necromancer</a>; once you have achieved level 50, you can start shifting into the minion build, even though the real power of this build comes from the paragon tree and its legendary nodes. You can check the final paragon tree in the following section. Here following you can see what your skill tree will looks like once you reach level 50, might change after the upcoming patch note out on 18th July.
