# HTML
Excersises and personal projects I work on while studying HTML and CSS,

I recently decided to dive into the world of the Front-End (or FE), 
using a website called freeCodeCamp.org. I am following the tutorials,
listed as they are in order, and so I started with HTML and CSS.
I am new to the world of the FE, or coding in general, and I am 
enjoying it so far!
